# FunzelUI

I've been using TailwindCSS for quite some time now, but I've come to the point where for every new project I had to redo styles for basic elements like inputs, buttons and especially modals that are really useful for me at least.


Introducing **FunzelUI**, a UI-Kit with basic Tailwind elements. Available soon in React, Svelte and Angular.
